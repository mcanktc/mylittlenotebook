✨ A beginner-friendly terminal-based notepad system built in Python.  🚀

# 📝 My First Python Project - Notepad System

This is my first complete Python project, simulating a user login and note-taking system in the terminal.

During my learning process, I wrote small snippets — calculators, input/output logic exercises, and function/loop challenges.
But I often felt inadequate, whether during quizzes or while working through exercises in the online course I took.

I built 3–4 small projects to accelerate my learning process, but this is the first one where I’ve used **everything I’ve learned** from day one until now.

I completed this project in just a few hours — and today is only my **third day learning Python**.

If you’re also in the learning phase, I hope _My Little Notebook_ inspires you and supports your journey through your own projects.
